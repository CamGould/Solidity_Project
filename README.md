### Background Information
Due to the volatility of cryptocurrency speculation, investors will often try to incorporate sentiment from social media and news articles to help guide their trading strategies. One such indicator is the [Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG)](https://zipmex.com/learn/crypto-fear-and-greed-index-explained/) which attempts to use a variety of data sources to produce a daily FNG value for cryptocurrency. I will build and evaluate deep learning models using both the FNG values and simple closing prices to determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for cryptocurrencies than the normal closing price data.
<br>
<br>
In this assignment, I will use ***deep learning recurrent neural networks*** to model bitcoin closing prices. One model will use the *FNG indicators* to predict the closing price while the second model will use a *window of closing prices* to predict the nth closing price.

### Project Outline and Instructions
#### Prepare the Data for Training and Testing
1. Create a Jupyter Notebook for each RNN.
2. For the Fear and Greed model, use the FNG values to try and predict the closing price.
3. For the closing price model, use previous closing prices to try and predict the next closing price. 
4. Each model will need to use 70% of the data for training and 30% of the data for testing.
5. Apply a MinMaxScaler to the X and y values to scale the data for the model.
6. Reshape the X_train and X_test values to fit the model's requirement of samples, time steps, and features.

#### Build and Train LSTM RNNs
1. In each Jupyter Notebook, create the same custom LSTM RNN architecture. 
    1. In the first notebook, fit the data using the FNG values. 
    2. In the second notebook, fit the data using only closing prices.

###  Key Findings and Visuals 
#### Visual Price Predictions of Each Model:
***The Model using Closing Price*** - the far better performing model:

***The Model using FNG Indicators*** - a poor performing model:

#### Evaluating the Performance of Each Model

*Which model has a lower loss?*
<br> 
The loss value for each epoch in the training and validation stage displays how well the model is behaving after each stage of its optimization. After looking at how the models each performed, it is no suprise that the **Closing Price Model** had a lower loss than the *FNG Model*. The results for eachof these can be found in their notebooks when the model is running the epochs.
<br>
<br>
*Which model tracks the actual values better over time?*
<br>
When comparing the two graphs of the outputs of each model it is not hard to tell that the **Closing Price Model** tracked the actual values far better. If the two models were closer, and we could not tell right away from the visuals, I would take the average distance the model's price prediction was off of the actual price to determine this answer.
<br>
<br>
*Which window size works best for the models?*
In the end I decided to go with a 10-day closing price window. I found that by having a larger window, the model was predicting prices. using smoother data. This in return helped to minimize some of the outliers, or extremes, that were effecting the model's accuracy of predictions.
